I am a second-year PhD student at City University of Hong Kong, specializing in the Natural Language Processing field. My research is primarily centered around exploring the factuality and interpretability within the context of Large Language Models.

Some of my past research works are:

* [Evaluating Factual Consistency of Summaries with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14069)
  Shiqi Chen, Siyang Gao, Junxian He
* [Composing Parameter-Efficient Modules with Arithmetic Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14870)
  Jinghan Zhang, Shiqi Chen, Junteng Liu, Junxian He
* [FacTool: Factuality Detection in Generative AI--A Tool Augmented Framework for Multi-Task and Multi-Domain Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13528)
  I Chern, Steffi Chern, Shiqi Chen, Weizhe Yuan, Kehua Feng, Chunting Zhou, Junxian He, Graham Neubig, Pengfei Liu
